# Disaster-Managment-with-UAVs-and-Real-Time-Pathfinding
Drone-based road detection using YOLOv8 segmentation and A* pathfinding. Images are split into grids, segmented, and stitched for accurate routing. Cars on roads are detected and optimal paths are planned. RF communication supports drone-to-base data transfer.
